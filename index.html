      <h2 id="fun_fact">Fun Fact!</h2>
      <p id="not_fun">Coding a website is a roller coaster. It's an adventure. It's a neverending tilt-a-whirl and I have motion sickness. But more than that, it is 4 separate seasons.</p>
      <h3 id="fact">But Heather! How is coding a website like the seasons?</h3>
      <p>Ah yes. Great Question. Let's Count the ways, shall we:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Spring</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yes, thank you for asking. We WILL be going a little bit out of order here!</li>
            <li>(Trust the Process)</li>
            <li>Spring is First</li>
            <li>(Because I like autumn more than spring)</li>
            <li>Spring is happy, hopeful and joyful.</li>
            <li>You can taste the summer in the air</li>
            <li>You can feel the good times comin'</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Watching a live coding demonstration in class is like Spring</li>
            Everything looks so easy, and makes so much sense.
            It feels hopeful and positive.
            You believe that it really is as easy as the professional expert makes it feel like it is.
            Spring is a LIE for winter is coming.</p>
        <li>Winter</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In the words of the Great William Shakespeare:</li>
            <li>"Now is the winter of our discontent"</li>
            <li>William Shakespeare, Richard III</li></ul>
            <p>And discontent is the feeling of winter in this metaphor.
            Everything is bleak, and hopeless.
            It turns out everything is much harder than expected.
            And you're always missing an all-important }.
            There's always 17 different ways of trying to the same thing.
            And its always so hard to know which ones to try.
            Spelling mistakes matter entirely too much
            A ;! A ;! My kingdom for a ;!
            (Also a William Shakespeare, Richard III quote, as it turns out).</p>
            
          <li>Fall</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Now Admittedly</li>
            <li>Summer isn't my favourite season. Fall is. True fall, proper autumn I should say</li>
            <li>Not that lame summer bleedover we sometimes get here instead of a crisp cool fall day</li>
            <li>this metaphor really should be summer then fall</li>
            <li>but for the sake of convention, I will go out of preferred order and do fall then summer</li></ul>
            <p>Fall is glorious.
            Cool in the mornings and evenings.
            Yet warm, or sometimes even downright hot during the day.
            It's easy and comfortable to sleep at night,
            but it's still warm enough to remember to drink water during the day.
            It's nice enough to be outside,
            but indoor basement nerds don't get shamed for staying in all day either.
            Winter is coming
            (with it's deliciously pleasant cooling chill and vibey-aesthetic)
            and so is Halloween, and Christmas, and the holiday season.
            When you start to finally get the code you're trying to do.
            Like I'm starting to do with css and with html.
            And everything feels a little better and happier.
            The good times are coming,
            but it also feels pretty hopeful and happy already
            and everything is starting to click into place and get better</p>
          
          <li>Summer</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Summer is great</li>
              <li>yes its too hot to exist</li>
              <li>it's too hot to be comfortable</li>
              <li>it's too hot to sleep</li>
              <li>but the sun doesn't set until 10 pm</li>
              <li>and the Seasonal Affective Disorder has left the city and everyone is just a little happier</li></ul>
              <p>Summer feels like the end of high school. The beginning of youth.
              The Promise of New Shiny things to a brain constantly craving new stimulation and challenges.
              Summer in coding is when you are flying,
              you've solved the problems,
              you have a vague understanding or better of what you are doing.
              You've built house, patched the cracks in the foundation, installed the windows and doors, painted the trim vibrant pink, and hung up all your posters of Fall Out Boy.
              The end is in sight,
              and you are almost free of the project</p>
